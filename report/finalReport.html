<h1>Introduction:</h2>
<br> An approach of reading historic data from Netcool reporter database and auto classify the alarms based on event processing status resulted previously.<br> 
<br> <b>Know your environment</b> - Using Machine learning clustering algorithm historic alarms will be grouped based on the respective event processing status.<br> 
<br> <b>Identify failures</b> - Perform sentiment analysis over the event processing status updates the respective results at alert fields which enables to identify problematic areas.<br> 
<br> <b>Automatic failure area identification</b> â€“ Failure areas are auto labled using kewords <b>ne-</b> represents sentiment result negative and <b> n- </b>represents sentiment result neutral.<br> 
<br>
<br> <i><b>Descion rule of thumb :-</b></i><br>
<br>
<br><b>1 - </b>Given alarm contains negative sentiment result for its any of the event processing states is considered as faulty event processing. <br>
<br><b>2 - </b>Given alarm contains neutral sentiment result for half and more than half of the input status fields. <br>
<br><b>3 - </b>Cluter numbered <b>-1</b> are called as outlier i.e new combination of issue is getting reported at env. <br>
<br> <i><b>Usage from the predection :-</b></i><br>
 <br> Missed event processing can be predected early by which required actions to address the event processing needs can be preformed (eg: Log collection for troubleshooting,Perform event processing manually to avoid busniess impact<br>
